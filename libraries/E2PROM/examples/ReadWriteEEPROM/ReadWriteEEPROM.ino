  Read/Write EEPROM example

  Example with the basic user access methods (write/read) 
  and functionality to 'get' and 'put' any data to and from EEPROM.

  
  First, it shows how to read/write a cell (1 byte) from the EEPROM.
  Then two objects, a double and an integer with known values,
  will be saved with E2PROM method put(); this value will be
  recovered with method get() and stored to a new variables intialized to 0.
  To check that the put/get methods were successful, those new
  variables with the read value will be printed.
