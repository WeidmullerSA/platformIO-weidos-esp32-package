  UART Send example

  This sketch periodically sends data over the UART interface.
  
  DIP switches MUST be configured to use UART:
  SW1: 4=OFF 1,2,3=indifferent
  SW2: 1=ON, 2=ON, 3=OFF, 4=OFF

  To receive what it's being sent, example UART_receive (File/Examples/UART/UART_receive) can be used in a second Weidos. Both Weidos'
  DIP switches MUST be configured to use UART. Wire pin11 <-> pin12 and pin12 <-> pin11.

  WARNING!!! DIP switches must be configured to use UART prior to ANY WIRING with your device POWERED OFF.
  WARNING!!! Not following this instructions may damage your device.
  WARNING!!! Check User Manual for more information.
