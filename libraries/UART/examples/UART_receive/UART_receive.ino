  UART Receieve example

  This sketch receives data over UART interface and outputs the data to the Serial Monitor.

  DIP switches MUST be configured to use UART:
  SW1: 4=OFF 1,2,3=indifferent
  SW2: 1=ON, 2=ON, 3=OFF, 4=OFF

  Example UART_send (File/Examples/UART/UART_send) can be used in a second Weidos to receive data from it. Both Weidos'
  DIP switches MUST be configured to use UART. Wire pin11 <-> pin12 and pin12 <-> pin11.
  
  WARNING!!! DIP switches must be configured to use UART prior to ANY WIRING with your device POWERED OFF.
  WARNING!!! Not following this instructions may damage your device.
  WARNING!!! Check User Manual for more information.
