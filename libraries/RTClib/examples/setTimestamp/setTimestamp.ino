 * This program has to be uploaded to the Weidos only once to set the local time in our RTC. 
 * In this case it takes the local time of our PC as the starting point to start counting,

 * 
 * It is important to emphasize that this program only has to be passed once to set the current time, 
 * from then on the RTC can always be consulted.
