  I2C Master Send example

  This sketch shows how to set up a Weidos as an I2C Master device and send data to an I2C Slave device.
  
  Use a second Weidos MKR1010 to run example I2C_slave_receive (File/Examples/I2C/I2C_slave_receive) in order to
  read data sent by this example. Wire both Weidos' I2C SDA and SCL pins (pin61<->pin61 and pin62<->pin62).
*/

#include <Wire.h>
#define SLAVE_ADDRS 0x55

void setup() {
  Wire.begin();     //Initialize Wire object with no argument so an I2C master is configured.
}

void loop() {
  delay(3000);
  Wire.beginTransmission(SLAVE_ADDRS);     //Begin transmision with the slave device with address = SLAVE_ADDRS (0x55)
  Wire.write(2);    //Data to send
  Wire.write(8);    //Data to send
  Wire.write(100);  //Data to send
  Wire.write(23);
  //Add any Wire.write() and it will be sent and received by the IC2_slave_receive example.
  Wire.endTransmission();
