  Analog Output example

  For the Analog Output pin (AO_0) it writes an analog value that goes from 0V to 10V over time.
  Once it reaches its maximum value (10V), after 5 seconds it starts again from 0V.
  Analog Output resolution is 10-bits (0-1023). 
  It also shows different namings for the Analog Output pin: 
  - Connector Number: pin45
  - Weidos pin name: AO_0
