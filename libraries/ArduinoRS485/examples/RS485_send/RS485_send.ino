  RS485 Send example

  This sketch periodically sends a string over the RS485 interface.
  
  DIP switches MUST be configured to use RS485:
  SW1: 4=ON 1,2,3=indifferent
  SW2: 1=OFF, 2=OFF, 3=ON, 4=ON

  To receive what it's being sent, example RS485_receive (File/Examples/RS485/RS485_receive) can be used in a second Weidos. Both Weidos'
  DIP switches MUST be configured to use RS485. Wire pin11 <-> pin11 and pin12 <-> pin12.

  WARNING!!! DIP switches must be configured to use RS485 prior to ANY WIRING with your device POWERED OFF.
  WARNING!!! Not following this instructions may damage your device.
  WARNING!!! Check User Manual for more information.
