  RS485 Receive example

  This sketch receives data over RS485 interface and outputs the data to the Serial Monitor.

  DIP switches MUST be configured to use RS485:
  SW1: 4=ON 1,2,3=indifferent
  SW2: 1=OFF, 2=OFF, 3=ON, 4=ON

  Example RS485_send (File/Examples/RS485/RS485_send) can be used in a second Weidos to receive data from it. Both Weidos'
  DIP switches MUST be configured to use RS485. Wire pin11 <-> pin11 and pin12 <-> pin12.
  
  WARNING!!! DIP switches must be configured to use RS485 prior to ANY WIRING with your device POWERED OFF.
  WARNING!!! Not following this instructions may damage your device.
  WARNING!!! Check User Manual for more information.
