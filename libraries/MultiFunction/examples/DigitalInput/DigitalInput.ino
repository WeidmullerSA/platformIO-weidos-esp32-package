  Multifunction pins as Digital Inputs example

  Constantly reads value from all Multifunction pins and prints it to the 
  Serial Monitor. It also shows that one can use different namings for the
  Multifunction pins: 
  - Connector Numbers: pin41, pin42
  - Weidos pin names: MF_0, MF_1
  
  Multi Function Input values are:
    - RANGE: 0V-3.3V or 0V-5V (depending on the DIP switches configuration)
    
  DIP switch configuration:
        0V-3.3V:  SW1: 1=ON, 2=ON, 3=ON,     4=indiferent   SW2=indiferent
        0V-5V:    SW1: 1=OFF, 2=OFF, 3=OFF,  4=indiferent   SW2=indiferent
