  Multifunction pins as Digital Outputs example

  Turns ON/OFF each multifunction pin sequentially.
  To check outputs use a multimeter or an LED.
  
  It also shows that one can use different naming for the
  Multifunction pins: 
  - Connector Numbers: pin41, pin42
  - Weidos pin names: MF_0, MF_1

  OUTPUT RANGE:
      LOW: GND
      HIGH: 3.3V or 5V (depending on the DIP switches configuration)

  DIP switch configuration:
        0V-3.3V:  SW1: 1=ON, 2=ON, 3=ON,     4=indiferent   SW2=indiferent
        0V-5V:    SW1: 1=OFF, 2=OFF, 3=OFF,  4=indiferent   SW2=indiferent
