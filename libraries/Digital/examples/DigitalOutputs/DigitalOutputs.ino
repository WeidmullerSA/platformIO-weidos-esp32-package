/**
  Digital Outputs example

  Turns ON/OFF each digital output sequentially.
  To check how it works, take a look on Weidos' LEDs.
  OUTPUT RANGE:
      LOW: GND
      HIGH: (Vin - 1V) (Vin = Weidos power supply voltage)

  It also shows that one can use different naming for the
  Digital Output pins: 
  - Connector Numbers: pin55, pin56, pin57, pin58
  - Weidos pin names: DO_0, DO_1, DO_2, DO_3
 */

  digitalWrite((pin57), HIGH);
