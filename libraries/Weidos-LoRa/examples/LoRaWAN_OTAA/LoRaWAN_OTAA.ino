/**
 LoRaWAN OTAA example.

 LoRaWAN OTAA example to join and send data to a gateway. Sending data can be done with and without confirmation. Downlink messages are also handled.  
 Note: This example requires a Gateway. Use "LoRa Radio Send" and "LoRa Radio Receive" examples to test LoRa without requiring a Gateway. 

 To use this example, create an Application to get its "Application EUI" and "Application Key". Register your "Device EUI" to your Application and 
 ensure you have good coverage with the Gateway.
