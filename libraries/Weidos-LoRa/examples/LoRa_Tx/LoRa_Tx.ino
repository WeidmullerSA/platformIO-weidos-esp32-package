 LoRa Tx example.

 Transmit data via LoRa without the need of a gateway, App Key, App EUI or other parameters
 since it does not uses LoRaWAN protocol, only the physical layer of LoRa.

 Note 1: Only hexadecimal characters can be sent (0123456789ABCDEF, non-case sensitive). 
 Note 2: use LoRa_Rx example with a second Weidos to check that the message is being sent.
